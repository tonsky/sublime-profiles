Hi!

If you were using Switch Settings, it is now replaced with Profile Switcher. Feature-wise Profile Switcher is the same, but I hope it provides a much smoother user experience. For example, restart is no longer required.

New commands:

- Profiles: Create (`create_profile`)
- Profiles: Switch (`switch_profile`)
- Profiles: Rename (`rename_profile`)
- Profiles: Delete (`delete_profile`)
- Profiles: Toggle Last Used (`toggle_profile`)
